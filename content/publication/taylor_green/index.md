Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence affects both terrestrial and astrophysical
plasmas. The properties of magnetized turbulence must be better understood to
more accurately characterize these systems. This work presents ideal MHD
simulations of the compressible Taylor-Green vortex under a range of initial
subsonic Mach numbers and magnetic field strengths. We find that regardless of
the initial field strength, the magnetic energy becomes dominant over the
kinetic energy on all scales after at most several dynamical times. The
spectral indices of the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra become shallower
than $k^{âˆ’5/3}$ over time and generally fluctuate. Using a shell-to-shell energy
transfer analysis framework, we find that the magnetic fields facilitate a
significant amount of the energy flux and that the kinetic energy cascade is
suppressed. Moreover, we observe nonlocal energy transfer from the large-scale
kinetic energy to intermediate and small-scale magnetic energy via magnetic
tension. We conclude that even in intermittently or singularly driven weakly
magnetized systems, the dynamical effects of magnetic fields cannot be
neglected.
