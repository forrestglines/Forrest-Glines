A shift is underway in high performance computing (HPC) towards heterogeneous
parallel architectures that emphasize medium and fine grain thread parallelism.
Many scientific computing algorithms, including simple finite-differencing
methods, have already been mapped to heterogeneous architectures with
order-of-magnitude gains in performance as a result. Recent case studies
examining high-resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) algorithms suggest that these
finite-volume methods are good candidates for emerging heterogeneous
architectures. HRSC methods form a key scientific kernel for compressible
inviscid solvers that appear in astrophysics and engineering applications and
tend to require enormous memory and computing resources. This work presents a
case study of an HRSC method executed on a heterogeneous parallel architecture
utilizing hundreds of GPU enabled nodes with remote direct memory access to the
GPUs for a non-trivial shock application using the relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics model.
