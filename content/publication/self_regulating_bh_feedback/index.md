In the universe's most massive galaxies, active galactic
nucleus (AGN) feedback appears to limit star formation. The
accumulation of cold gas near the central black hole fuels
powerful AGN outbursts, keeping the ambient medium in a
state marginally unstable to condensation and formation of
cold gas clouds. However, the ability of that mechanism to
self-regulate may depend on numerous environmental factors,
including the depth of the potential well and the pressure
of the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM). Here we
present a suite of numerical simulations, with halo mass
ranging from $2\times10^{12} M_\odot$ to $8\times10^{14} M_\odot$, exploring the
dependence of AGN feedback on those environmental factors.
We include the spatially extended mass and energy input
from the massive galaxy's old stellar population capable of
sweeping gas out of the galaxy if the confining CGM
pressure is sufficiently low. Our simulations show that
this feedback mechanism is tightly self-regulating in a
massive galaxy with a deep central potential and low CGM
pressure, permitting only small amounts of multiphase gas
to accumulate and allowing no star formation. In a
similar-mass galaxy with shallower central potential and
greater CGM pressure the feedback mechanism is more
episodic, producing extended multiphase gas and allowing
small rates of star formation ($\sim0.1 M_\odot \text{yr}^{âˆ’1}$). At the
low-mass end, the mechanism becomes implausibly explosive,
perhaps because the CGM initially has no angular momentum,
which would have reduced the amount of condensed gas
capable of fueling feedback.
