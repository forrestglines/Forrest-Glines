I am a new Metropolis Postdoctoral Fellow at Los Alamos
National Laboratory studying astrophysical plasmas using large scale
simulations with high performance computing. My research at Los Alamos explores
the behavior of jets launched from binary black hole mergers embedded within
accretion disks to determine their observational signatures. These studies are
enabled by the
[AthenaPK](https://gitlab.com/theias/hpc/jmstone/athena-parthenon/athenapk)
exascale-ready magnetohydrodynamics code which I helped develop as a PhD
student at Michigan State University.

My broader research covers simulations of galaxy clusters with self-regulating
AGN feedback, simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, numerical methods
for magnetized Newtonian and relativistic plasmas, and performance-portable
    astrophysics codes.

Feel free to contact me for collaboration via [email](mailto:glines@lanl.gov).
