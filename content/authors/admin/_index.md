I am currently a graduate student at Michigan State University and an intern with Sandia National Labs.

My research covers simulations of galaxy clusters with self-regulating AGN feedback, simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, improving Newtonian and relativistic methods for evolving plasmas, and developing performance portable astrophysics codes.
