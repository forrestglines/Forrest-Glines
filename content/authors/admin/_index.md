I am a Metropolis Postdoctoral Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory
studying astrophysical plasmas using exascale GPU-based resources. My work at Los
Alamos is currently focused on developing
[AthenaPK](https://gitlab.com/theias/hpc/jmstone/athena-parthenon/athenapk), an
exascale magnetohydrodynamics code, and
[Parthenon](https://github.com/parthenon-hpc-lab/parthenon), the adaptive mesh
refinement framework that powers AthenaPK.
With AthenaPK, I run simulations of astrophysical jets in various scenarios on
[Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/), the world's first exascale supercomputer.

My computational intrests focus on  enabling scientific computing on GPUs via
the development of performance-portable codes: codes that are capable of high
performance on various GPU and CPU architectures.

Feel free to contact me for collaboration via [email](mailto:glines@lanl.gov).
