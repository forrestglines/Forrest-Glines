I am a graduate student in Astrophysics and Computational Mathematics, Science
and Engineering at Michigan State University and a graduate student researcher
at Sandia National Laboratories.

My research covers simulations of galaxy clusters with self-regulating AGN
feedback, simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, numerical methods for
magnetized Newtonian and relativistic plasmas, and performance-portable
astrophysics codes.

I am looking for post doctoral oppotrunities in astrophysics and computational
science for 2022. Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:glinesfo@msu.edu).
