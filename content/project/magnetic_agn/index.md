My current focus is the development of next-generation simulations of
magnetized galaxy clusters with magnetized active galactic nuclei (AGN)
feedback, done in tandem with development of AthenaPK and Parthenon. High
computational efficiency on CPUs and GPUs enabled by the Parthenon adaptive
mesh refinement framework will allow higher resolution and higher fidelity
simulations than previously possible.

The simulations use realistic gravitational and entropy profiles of galaxy
cluster with a tabulated cooling function. Feedback from AGN is triggered by
cold gas accreted into the AGN and is deposited into the intracluster medium
via thermal heating, precessing kinetic jets, and a magnetic tower.
