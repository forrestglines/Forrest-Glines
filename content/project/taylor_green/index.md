Taking advantage of the efficiency that K-Athena allowed, we ran a series of
simulations of the magnetized Taylor-Green vortex to study the behavior of
magnetized turbulence that decays from a large scale flow without a driving
force.  Using an energy transfer analysis, we found [look at my abstract]
