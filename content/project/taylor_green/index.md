To investigate the development of turbulence in intermittently driven plasmas
such as the intracluster medium, we used our newly developed K-Athena code to
run a series of simulations of the magnetized Taylor-Green vortex. The
turbulence that arises from the unsteady flow of the magnetized Taylor-Green
vortex models the turbulence that develops from large scale infrequent events
such as galaxy cluster mergers disturbing the intracluster medium. In our
paper, we examine the magnitude and the spectra of the kinetic, magnetic, and
thermal energy reservoirs within the plasma. Additionally, we apply an energy
transfer analysis to study the movement of energy between different length
scale and between different reservoirs 


Our full setup, explanation, and analysis can be found in
