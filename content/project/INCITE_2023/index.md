Myself and a group of collaborators  were awarded an [INCITE 2023
Award](https://www.anl.gov/article/incite-program-awards-supercomputing-time-to-56-projects-to-accelerate-science-and-engineering)
to perform exascale simulations of galaxy clusters with magnetized jets powered
by a central active galactic nuclei (AGN). Galaxy clusters, as the largest
gravitationally bound structures, provide a unique probe of large scale
structure in the universe. The magnetized AGN jets play a key role in the
dynamics of baryonic matter in galaxy clusters and thus observational
signatures of clusters.

These simulations are enabled by
[AthenaPK](https://github.com/parthenon-hpc-lab/athenapk), our exascale capable
performance portable astrophysics code. I am currently working on optimizing
these AthenaPK simulations on the exascale supercomputer Frontier.
